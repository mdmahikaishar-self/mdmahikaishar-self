Alhamdulillah. I had done the work so quickly. The brother was so happy on me and impressed by my work. That's why he gave me, my first earn by coding. It was a dream.

Brother was so impressed on my work. He was a civil engineer and JAVA programmer. He offered me to go to Dhaka and work with him. He was also offered me that he will be bear my all responsibility. But, very sadly my parents are not allowed me to go there. I missed the change.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Journey on Coding

#### üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How I get the idea

My father was a computer teacher. So, we have our own computer. I'm using computer when I was in play or nursery. When I was in class 4. I had made some configuration of a video player (Pot Player) like changing the welcome screen. Then, I was so curious. I heard the terms of Software engineering. In a few days, I become more serious on computer.

I met up with a brother. He asked me what your aim was. I replied that programming, I want to be a software engineer. That time I was not familiar with programming language. He told me at first I should learn HTML then CUSS. I started my joinery on real programming.

#### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How do I start?

After few months, I turn myself in to Python. I have done lots of projects like GUI, terminal based application, game, frontend, backend, web scraping, extra. I've also done an AI based project for sentiment checking.

But, I my first wish was making an Operating System (OS). That‚Äôs why I had done lots of reading articles, blog etc. Sometime later, I got the idea. Its need lots of knowledge. That's why I had learn C and C++.

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Becoming Full Stack developer

Unfortunately I moved on Python again. Sometimes latter, I met up a new person. He told me to stick on a one language. So I decided to stick on Python.

It's not end, few days letter, the brother took a course in JavaScript Web development. He also tell me to join the course. But, I had not enough money. So he told me that web development has a bright future. That's why I should learn JavaScript
